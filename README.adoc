"This book is a must read for network software developers. It covers in great
detail how Network Applications can be accelerated with Data Plane Development
Kit (DPDK). In particular, it describes libraries, tools and techniques to
optimize Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Network
(SDN) data plane performance by more than a factor of ten. It is an excellent
showcase of a close knit collaboration between Intel and Juniper engineers over
many years to deliver high performance and cloud scale applications for the
networking industry. I am impressed with its thoroughness and wealth of
practical, hands-on information. In summary, this book rocks."
-- Rajesh Gadiyar, Vice President and CTO, Network Platforms Group, Intel Corporation

"This is a superb book. Four Juniper engineers have combined their experience
in working with DPDK and its use as an open source data plane for SDN
(vRouter). Step-by-step the authors describe the innards of vRouter and show
you how to configure, optimize, and troubleshoot one of the best SDN solutions
in the marketplace. Congratulations to the authors, and to you the reader who
are about to be impressed."
-- Raj Yavatkar, CTO, Juniper Networks

== Key Juniper Contrail Resources

The Juniper TechLibrary has been supporting Contrail with its excellent
documentation for years. The Contrail selection is thorough, and it’s kept
up-to-date with the latest technologies and GUI changes. This book is no
substitution for that body of information. 

== book content

=== topics

* You will understand SDN basics.
* You will be able to apply DPDK and network virtualization technologies.
* You will be able to identify Contrail vRouter DPDK internal architectures.
* You will be able to manage packet forwarding flows in DPDK vRouter.
* You will know how to install contrail and the traffic testing tools.
* You will be familiar with the utilities available for DPDK vRouter to troubleshoot and analyze DPDK performance

=== chapters

This book details the long list of Juniper Contrail features that can enrich
DPDK implementations in vRouter. It starts with the basics and builds from
there to cover more complex setups. It’s structured as follows:

* Chapter 1 provides an SDN overview.
* Chapter 2 introduces virtualization concepts.
* Chapter 3 elaborates DPDK vRouter architecture in detail.
* Chapter 4 covers DPDK vRouter fine tuning.
* Chapter 5 reviews key Contrail and testing tool installations.
* Chapter 6 details DPDK vRouter tools and some lab studies.
